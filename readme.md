# Ping Pong Tournament Edition

### The Develop.Me final project app

## The Brief:

>The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.

>Its up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

>Optional advanced features might include:
ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
continued rounds until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other)

## Project Notes

From the outset, I knew I wanted to fulfill the brief by creating a React+redux app.  From the training and practical coding we had undertaken on the course, I knew that the input and state handling that react+redux provide would be a good fit for this task. 

I created wireframes to visualise how I saw the app rendering on the screen, and in the back of my mind was working on a design and color scheme inspired by the classic Dunlop Table Tennis Bat.

HOWEVER, after a week or so of attempting to build a working app with React, reality bit and I realised that I was not going to fulfill the brief in time.  These failed attempts can be found in a separate repository *(link tbc)*

Therefore, I resorted to Plan B: html, css, & javascript/jquery

## What's missing

While the app fulfils the basic brief, there are many things missing from this version which I would have liked to include.  The following is by no means an exhaustive list!

+ Obviously, the ability to pick a winner, knockout the loser and generate subsequent rounds
+ disable the **Add Player** button until something is entered in the input
+ validation for names in the add player input
+ disable the **Create Tournament** button until at least two names have been entered
